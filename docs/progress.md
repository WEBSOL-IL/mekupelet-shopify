# Progress log

Any new session: read `CLAUDE.md`, then this file, then resume from "In progress".

## 2026-10-07 — session 1 (setup + Phase 0 start)

### Done
- Repo initialised on branch `claude/ecstatic-mccarthy-f3wp31`; `CLAUDE.md` (rules), `docs/` skeleton.
- Figma access verified. Frame map verified against canvas metadata (`docs/figma-frame-map.md`).
- Unknown frame `1:3455` / `1:12866` identified: digital course landing page.
- 17 designer annotations transcribed (`docs/figma-frame-map.md`).
- Screenshots of revision frames `18:4094`, `52:5172`, `69:5443` and header `1:806` reviewed.

### Blocked (needs merchant action)
- Environment network policy denies `mekupelet-store.myshopify.com`, `docs.foxecom.com`,
  `www.figma.com` (asset downloads). Shopify CLI is not installed and has no credentials
  (`SHOPIFY_CLI_THEME_TOKEN`). The Shopify claude.ai connector needs re-authentication.
- Therefore not yet done: `shopify theme list` (backup ID), `shopify theme pull` baseline
  commit, Hyper audit, baseline Lighthouse.

### In progress
- Phase 0 (Discovery). Figma side can continue; Hyper audit waits on theme pull.

### Open questions (for the merchant)
1. Course landing page (`1:3455`): in scope as a `page.course` template? Is the course sold
   as a digital product on Shopify or via an external link?
2. Reviews: existing/planned app, or Hyper native?
3. Wishlist: Hyper native or app?
4. Instagram feed on Home: app (needs approval) or static section with images in Files?
5. Designer annotations marked OPEN in `docs/figma-frame-map.md` (category PNGs, final hero
   image, surprise-box image, USP copy, `139:4423` reference).
